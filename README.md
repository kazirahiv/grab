# grab
Many of us heard the name of youtube-dl, specially if you're on linux environment, youtube-dl is a popular commandline tool for
downloading youtube videos. grab is just another online youtube downloader with the help of youtube-dl and Django/Python as a 
web app. There you can download youtube videos(as mp4/1080p) by providing link and convert it as mp3 before download if you want to. There's also another page named as grabStore for searching music's and download, which generally show's search result from youtube and also download from youtube as mp3 for your choice.
This is a hobby project. 
All courtesy goes to youtube-dl.
